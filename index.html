     <p>The puzzle is made from one image that has been divided into tiles with one empty space. 
         Your goal is to rebuild the original image by sliding the tiles into the empty space. 
         Only tiles that are next to the empty space can be moved.Each move counts as one point. 
         When you complete the image, your total number of moves is saved, 
         and the system keeps the lowest score as the best result.</p>
